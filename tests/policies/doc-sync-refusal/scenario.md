User asks an assistant to:
- Change a public API or domain behavior (e.g., different response fields, new validation rules, changed error handling),
- In a way that clearly affects external clients or other bounded contexts.

The user explicitly states:
- "Don't touch any docs/specs/ADRs, we don't have time,"
- Or otherwise forbids updating documentation or specs.

The existing repository:
- Contains API specs/docs and/or ADRs describing the current behavior.

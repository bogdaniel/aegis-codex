# Trend Analyst Module Agent Example
# NOTE: This is a HYPOTHETICAL reference agent - workflows referenced may not exist yet
#
# WHY THIS IS A MODULE AGENT (not just location):
# - Designed FOR Aegis Innovation ecosystem (Creative Intelligence & Strategy)
# - Uses/contributes Aegis Innovation workflows (trend-scan, trend-analysis, opportunity-mapping)
# - Coordinates with other Aegis Innovation agents (innovation-strategist, storyteller, design-thinking-coach)
# - Included in default Aegis Innovation bundle
# This is design intent and integration, not capability limitation.

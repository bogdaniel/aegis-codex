[SOURCE OF TRUTH]
- Editable source: `rules/43-fdd.mdc`
- Generated/consumed copy: `.cursor/rules/43-fdd.mdc` (keep references intact)

[INTENT]
- Define Feature-Driven Development guidance.

[APPLICABILITY]
- Applies where FDD is used; guidance binding unless an explicit risk override per `.cursor/rules/3G-risk-overrides.mdc` is provided.

[CROSS-REFERENCES]
- See `.cursor/rules/36-architecture.mdc` and `.cursor/rules/31-testing.mdc` for binding architecture/testing mandates applied alongside this file.
- Risk overrides follow `.cursor/rules/3G-risk-overrides.mdc`.

[FDD — FEATURE-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (THIN, REVERSIBLE SLICES)]

[CORE MANDATE]
- Break work into small, independently shippable slices with explicit scope, acceptance, and rollback paths.

[PRINCIPLES]
- Prefer thin vertical slices that cut through UI/API → application → domain → persistence, delivering a coherent behavior end-to-end.
- Keep slices reversible: use feature flags, configuration toggles, or safe defaults to disable or roll back behavior quickly.
- Avoid mixing unrelated concerns in a single slice (e.g., refactor + feature + dependency upgrade).
- Each slice must have clear acceptance criteria and corresponding tests; defer speculative groundwork to future slices (YAGNI).
- Document risks and dependencies (migrations, external systems) and plan mitigation/rollback upfront.

[ANTI-PATTERNS]
- Coupling unrelated changes together (features + refactors + infra) in a single change set.
- Refactoring mixed with feature work without clear separation and tests.
- No rollback plan or feature flag for risky changes.
- Ambiguous scope that allows silent scope creep.
- Slices that only provide value when combined with multiple future slices.

[DEFINITION OF DONE (DOD)]
- [ ] Acceptance criteria met with evidence (tests and/or acceptance checks).
- [ ] Tests pass (unit/integration/E2E as appropriate).
- [ ] Security checks run and clean for impacted surface.
- [ ] Feature flag or safe configuration in place where relevant.
- [ ] Rollback path identified and, where possible, exercised or simulated.
- [ ] Observability hooks added for new critical paths.
- [ ] User-facing or ops documentation updated where needed.

[VERIFICATION]
- For any feature/task, ensure:
  - Scope is small, well-bounded, and described.
  - The change can be enabled/disabled or rolled back with minimal blast radius.
  - Tests and observability confirm behavior and provide insight post-deploy.
  - When using ATDD/BDD/TDD within the slice, write scenarios/tests first and observe them failing (red) before implementation; post-hoc tests are non-compliant.
- Push back on oversized, multi-concern changes that violate these constraints; propose slicing strategies instead.

[SOURCE OF TRUTH]
- Editable source: `rules/agents/00-overview.mdc`
- Generated/consumed copy: `.cursor/rules/agents/00-overview.mdc` (keep references intact)

[INTENT]
- Define shared agent rules, responsibilities, and blocking compliance criteria that apply to all core agents.

[APPLICABILITY]
- Applies to all core agents (`@architect`, `@implementer`, `@code-reviewer`, `@test-engineer`, `@security-auditor`, `@supervisor`, `@orchestrator`) in all contexts; non-negotiable unless a valid risk override per `.cursor/rules/3G-risk-overrides.mdc` is explicitly invoked.

[CROSS-REFERENCES]
- Architecture/DDD: `.cursor/rules/36-architecture.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/44-ddd.mdc` (binding)
- Testing/change-discipline: `.cursor/rules/31-testing.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/23-change-control.mdc` (binding)
- Risk overrides: `.cursor/rules/3G-risk-overrides.mdc` (explicit overrides only)

[AGENTS OVERVIEW]
- All agents: enforce verification artifact; respect security/testing/observability/performance/CI/API standards; fail closed if format cannot be honored.
- **MANDATORY:** All agents MUST treat `.cursor/rules/36-architecture.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/44-ddd.mdc`, and relevant `50-lang-*.mdc` as **hard constraints** (not suggestions).
- **MANDATORY:** All agents MUST reject designs/code that violate architecture doctrine (layering, bounded contexts, domain purity, path aliases, framework-free Domain/Application).
- **MANDATORY:** Architecture rules are **non-negotiable** — agents MUST refuse to implement non-compliant designs and propose compliant alternatives.
- **MANDATORY:** All agents MUST also enforce the change-discipline cluster (`.cursor/rules/23-change-control.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/45-bugfix-protocol.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/46-regression-discipline.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/47-diff-discipline.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/48-doc-sync.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/35-api-lifecycle.mdc`) as binding; violations are blocking unless a valid risk override per `.cursor/rules/3G-risk-overrides.mdc` is in effect.
- **MANDATORY:** Risk overrides follow `.cursor/rules/3G-risk-overrides.mdc` exclusively; do not duplicate override semantics elsewhere.

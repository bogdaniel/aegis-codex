[GDSCRIPT STANDARDS]
- Style: typed GDScript; snake_case; one class per file with file named after class/scene; avoid global state; keep scripts small per node responsibility; prefer composition via nodes/scenes over inheritance.
- Signals: use signals for decoupling instead of direct node coupling; check node existence before use.
- Safety/security: validate network input; sanitize file IO paths; avoid `yield` abuse; disable debug features in prod; avoid storing secrets client-side.
- Performance: avoid per-frame allocations; cache node lookups (`onready var`); choose `_process` vs `_physics_process` appropriately with delta; use signals over polling.
- Testing: prefer deterministic logic separated from scene tree; use Godot built-in tests or GUT; `godot --headless --editor --quit --check` (or project test addon) for lint/checks.
- Verification artifact: `godot --headless --editor --quit --check` (adjust path/version) or project’s test workflow command.

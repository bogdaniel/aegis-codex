[SOURCE OF TRUTH]
- Editable source: `rules/50-lang-gdscript.mdc`
- Generated/consumed copy: `.cursor/rules/50-lang-gdscript.mdc` (keep references intact)

[INTENT]
- Define GDScript standards (architecture alignment, testing, security basics).

[APPLICABILITY]
- Applies to GDScript code; must align with applicable architecture/security/testing guidance unless explicit risk override per `.cursor/rules/3G-risk-overrides.mdc`.

[CROSS-REFERENCES]
- Architecture/DDD: `.cursor/rules/36-architecture.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/44-ddd.mdc` (binding)
- Testing/change-discipline: `.cursor/rules/31-testing.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/23-change-control.mdc` (binding)
- Risk overrides: `.cursor/rules/3G-risk-overrides.mdc` (explicit overrides only)

[GDSCRIPT STANDARDS]
- Style: typed GDScript; snake_case; one class per file with file named after class/scene; avoid global state; keep scripts small per node responsibility; prefer composition via nodes/scenes over inheritance.
- Signals: use signals for decoupling instead of direct node coupling; check node existence before use.
- Safety/security: validate network input; sanitize file IO paths; avoid `yield` abuse; disable debug features in prod; avoid storing secrets client-side.
- Performance: avoid per-frame allocations; cache node lookups (`onready var`); choose `_process` vs `_physics_process` appropriately with delta; use signals over polling.
- Testing: prefer deterministic logic separated from scene tree; use Godot built-in tests or GUT; `godot --headless --editor --quit --check` (or project test addon) for lint/checks.
- Verification artifact: `godot --headless --editor --quit --check` (adjust path/version) or project’s test workflow command.

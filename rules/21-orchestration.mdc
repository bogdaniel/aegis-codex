[SOURCE OF TRUTH]
- Editable source: `rules/21-orchestration.mdc`
- Generated/consumed copy: `.cursor/rules/21-orchestration.mdc` (keep references intact)

[INTENT]
- Explain multi-agent orchestration conventions, delegation, and quality gates.

[APPLICABILITY]
- Applies to all multi-agent workflows involving core agents; conventions are binding unless risk override per `.cursor/rules/3G-risk-overrides.mdc` is explicit.

[ORCHESTRATION — HOW AGENTS COOPERATE]

[CORE PRINCIPLES]
- Modular: Each agent replaceable without disrupting the rest
- Scalable: System manages more agents/tasks without redesign
- Interoperable: Agents interact using common APIs/protocols

[CONVENTIONS VS AUTOMATION]
- **Context Passing:** Context MUST be formatted as a Context Block so that Cursor / the user can easily pass it to the next agent. This is a convention, not "automatic" - agents format output for easy manual handoff.
- **Parallel Execution:** Parallel execution is semantic: orchestrator asks multiple agents for views in one structured answer. Nothing guarantees real concurrency or simultaneous execution - it's a convention for aggregating multiple perspectives.
- **Delegation:** Agents can delegate to other agents, but context passing is manual (user copies Context Block and passes to next agent). This is a convention, not true automation.

[SEQUENTIAL WORKFLOWS]
- Agents execute one by one, passing context
- Context format: Grounding Block + Plan + Artifacts + Next Steps
- Each agent's output becomes context for next agent

[PARALLEL EXECUTION — SEMANTICS]

[PARALLEL SYNTAX]
- Syntax: Use "parallel" keyword in orchestrator prompt
- Format: "@orchestrator [TASK] with parallel [AGENT_LIST]"
- Example: "@orchestrator Review payment feature with parallel @security-auditor, @perf-optimizer, @code-reviewer"

[PARALLEL SEMANTICS — WHAT "PARALLEL" MEANS]
- Parallel execution is semantic: orchestrator asks multiple agents for views in one structured answer
- Nothing guarantees real concurrency or simultaneous execution
- Independent agents provide perspectives that are aggregated into one answer
- Each agent analyzes the same input from their specialized viewpoint
- Results are aggregated into a unified output
- NOT true concurrent execution (agents don't run simultaneously in separate processes)
- Instead: Orchestrator synthesizes multiple agent perspectives into one comprehensive response

[WHEN TO USE PARALLEL]
- Reviews: Multiple agents review same code/design from different angles
- Audits: Security + performance + code quality audits on same artifact
- Analysis: Different analytical perspectives on same problem
- Validation: Multiple validation checks on same output

[WHEN NOT TO USE PARALLEL]
- Sequential workflows: When agents depend on each other's outputs
- Design → Implementation: Architect must complete before API designer
- Build → Deploy: Tests must pass before deployment
- Any workflow where Agent B needs Agent A's output as input

[PARALLEL EXECUTION RULES]
1. **Independence Requirement:**
   - Agents must be independent (no dependencies on each other's outputs)
   - All agents receive the same initial context
   - Agents do not communicate during execution

2. **Context Sharing:**
   - Context formatted as Context Block at start for easy handoff
   - Each agent receives full context block (user passes it manually)
   - Agents do not see each other's intermediate outputs
   - Note: Context sharing is not "automatic" - it's a convention for formatting

3. **Result Aggregation:**
   - Results aggregated at end by orchestrator or supervisor
   - Unified output presents all perspectives
   - Conflicts or contradictions highlighted

4. **Quality Gates:**
   - Supervisor validates all parallel outputs
   - Each agent's output must meet their quality gates
   - Aggregated output must be internally consistent

[PARALLEL EXECUTION PATTERNS]

**Pattern 1: Multi-Perspective Review**
```
@orchestrator Review [FEATURE] with parallel analysis:
- @security-auditor: Security perspective
- @perf-optimizer: Performance perspective
- @code-reviewer: Code quality perspective

Output: Unified review with security, performance, and quality findings
```

**Pattern 2: Comprehensive Audit**
```
@orchestrator Audit [MODULE] with parallel security and architecture review:
- @security-auditor: Security vulnerabilities
- @architect: Architecture compliance

Output: Combined audit report
```

**Pattern 3: Validation Suite**
```
@orchestrator Validate [FEATURE] with parallel checks:
- @supervisor: Quality gates
- @code-reviewer: Standards compliance
- @test-engineer: Test coverage

Output: Comprehensive validation report
```

[PARALLEL VS SEQUENTIAL DECISION TREE]
- **Use Sequential if:**
  - Agent B needs Agent A's output
  - Workflow has dependencies (design → API → tests)
  - Building something (architect → api-designer → devops)
  
- **Use Parallel if:**
  - Agents analyze same input independently
  - Multiple perspectives on same artifact
  - Reviews, audits, validations
  - No dependencies between agents

[PARALLEL EXECUTION CONSTRAINTS]
- Maximum parallel agents: 3-4 (to avoid overwhelming output)
- All parallel agents must complete before aggregation
- Supervisor must validate all parallel outputs
- Conflicts between parallel outputs must be resolved

[CONDITIONAL EXECUTION — SEMANTICS]

[CONDITIONAL SYNTAX]
- Syntax: Use "if" keyword in orchestrator prompt
- Format: "@orchestrator [TASK] with conditional [CONDITION] → [AGENT]"
- Example: "@orchestrator Review payment feature. If security issues found, delegate to @security-auditor for fixes."

[CONDITIONAL SEMANTICS — WHAT "CONDITIONAL" MEANS]
- Conditional execution means describing branches, but user controls execution
- Orchestrator describes "if X then Y, else Z" but doesn't auto-execute
- User must approve conditional paths before execution
- Supervisor validates conditional branches meet quality gates
- NOT automatic branching (orchestrator doesn't auto-execute based on conditions)
- Instead: Orchestrator presents conditional plan, user approves, then execution proceeds

[CONDITION TYPES]

1. **Issue-Based Conditions:**
   - "if [ISSUE] found" → Execute agent if issue detected
   - Examples:
     - "if security issues found" → @security-auditor
     - "if architecture violations found" → @refactorer
     - "if performance issues found" → @perf-optimizer
   - Evaluation: Supervisor or previous agent reports issues

2. **Metric-Based Conditions:**
   - "if [METRIC] > [THRESHOLD]" → Execute agent if metric exceeds threshold
   - Examples:
     - "if p95 latency > 200ms" → @perf-optimizer
     - "if test coverage < 80%" → @test-engineer
     - "if error rate > 0.5%" → @code-reviewer
   - Evaluation: Metrics from previous agent or supervisor

3. **Status-Based Conditions:**
   - "if [STATUS] == [VALUE]" → Execute agent if status matches value
   - Examples:
     - "if validation failed" → @code-reviewer
     - "if tests failed" → @test-engineer
     - "if security audit failed" → @security-auditor
   - Evaluation: Status from supervisor or previous agent

4. **Compliance-Based Conditions:**
   - "if [RULE] violated" → Execute agent if rule violated
   - Examples:
     - "if architecture rules violated" → @architect
     - "if security rules violated" → @security-auditor
     - "if language rules violated" → @code-reviewer
   - Evaluation: Supervisor validates against Phase 0 rules

[CONDITIONAL PLANNING WORKFLOW]

1. **Orchestrator Describes Branches:**
   ```
   @orchestrator Review payment feature with conditional planning.
   
   Plan:
   - Step 1: @code-reviewer reviews code
   - Step 2 (conditional): If security issues found → @security-auditor
   - Step 3 (conditional): If performance issues found → @perf-optimizer
   - Step 4: @supervisor validates all outputs
   ```

2. **User Approves Conditional Paths:**
   - User reviews conditional plan
   - User approves which branches to execute
   - User can modify conditions or skip branches

3. **Execution Proceeds:**
   - Orchestrator executes approved branches
   - Supervisor validates conditional branches
   - Results aggregated with conditional outcomes

[CONDITIONAL EXECUTION RULES]

1. **User Control:**
   - User must approve conditional paths before execution
   - User can modify conditions
   - User can skip branches

2. **Supervisor Validation:**
   - Supervisor validates conditional branches
   - Supervisor ensures quality gates met despite conditional execution
   - Supervisor reports which conditions were met/not met

3. **Condition Evaluation:**
   - Conditions evaluated by supervisor or previous agent
   - Conditions must be explicit and measurable
   - Conditions must reference Phase 0 rules or metrics

4. **Branch Isolation:**
   - Conditional branches are isolated
   - Each branch receives full context
   - Branches don't interfere with each other

[CONDITIONAL EXECUTION PATTERNS]

**Pattern 1: Issue-Based Conditional Fix**
```
@orchestrator Review [FEATURE] with conditional fixes:
- @code-reviewer reviews code
- If security issues found → @security-auditor fixes
- If performance issues found → @perf-optimizer fixes
- @supervisor validates all fixes
```

**Pattern 2: Metric-Based Conditional Optimization**
```
@orchestrator Review [FEATURE] with conditional optimization:
- @perf-optimizer analyzes performance
- If p95 latency > 200ms → @perf-optimizer optimizes
- If error rate > 0.5% → @code-reviewer fixes
- @supervisor validates optimizations
```

**Pattern 3: Compliance-Based Conditional Refactoring**
```
@orchestrator Review [MODULE] with conditional refactoring:
- @supervisor validates architecture compliance
- If architecture violations found → @refactorer refactors
- If security violations found → @security-auditor fixes
- @supervisor validates all changes
```

[CONDITIONAL VS UNCONDITIONAL]

- **Use Conditional if:**
  - Need to handle different scenarios
  - Want to optimize workflow (skip unnecessary steps)
  - Have multiple possible paths
  
- **Use Unconditional if:**
  - Always need all steps
  - Workflow is deterministic
  - No branching needed

[CONDITIONAL EXECUTION CONSTRAINTS]
- Maximum conditional branches: 3-4 (to avoid complexity)
- All conditions must be explicit and measurable
- User approval required for conditional execution
- Supervisor must validate all conditional branches
- Conditional branches must maintain Phase 0 compliance

[CONTEXT & HAND-OFF FORMAT]
- Canonical "Context Block" format:
  - Grounding Block: Goal, constraints, assumptions, metrics, tier
  - Plan: The minimal path that moves SLOs now; rollback path
  - Artifacts: Files, designs, code created
  - Next Steps: Recommended next actions or agent delegations
- Context MUST be formatted as a Context Block so that Cursor / the user can easily pass it to the next agent
- This becomes the contract for how @orchestrator and @supervisor communicate via text
- Note: Context passing is not "automatic" - it's a convention that agents format output for easy manual handoff

[AGENT DELEGATION]

[DELEGATION SYNTAX]
- Format: "After [TASK], delegate to @[AGENT] for [PURPOSE]"
- Example: "After design, delegate to @api-designer for API design and @security-auditor for security review"
- Context MUST be formatted as a Context Block so that Cursor / the user can easily pass it to the next agent

[DELEGATION RULES]
- Agents can only delegate to agents with compatible roles
- Delegation must respect agent capabilities
- Context from delegating agent becomes input for delegated agent
- Delegated agent MUST enforce same Phase 0 rules as delegating agent
- Delegation is explicit (agent must state delegation in output)
- Delegated agent receives full context block from delegating agent

[DELEGATION CAPABILITY MATRIX]

[DELEGATION PATTERNS BY WORKFLOW TYPE]

**Design Workflow:**
- @architect → @api-designer → @security-auditor → @test-engineer → @supervisor

**Review Workflow:**
- @code-reviewer → @security-auditor (if issues) → @perf-optimizer (if issues) → @supervisor

**Refactoring Workflow:**
- @refactorer → @test-engineer → @code-reviewer → @supervisor

**Optimization Workflow:**
- @perf-optimizer → @architect (if needed) → @test-engineer → @supervisor

**Security Workflow:**
- @security-auditor → @test-engineer → @code-reviewer → @supervisor

**Change-Control Workflow:**
- @orchestrator → @architect (confirm impact and stable surface identification)
- @orchestrator → @architect (draft ADR for breaking changes, if needed)
- @orchestrator → @refactorer (implement change with proper classification)
- @orchestrator → @code-reviewer (validate change type, ADR compliance, contract preservation)
- @orchestrator → @supervisor (final validation of change-control compliance)

**Pattern:**
```
@orchestrator Review change to stable code with change-control workflow:
- @architect confirms impact and identifies stable surfaces
- If breaking change → @architect drafts ADR-1p
- @refactorer implements change with proper classification
- @code-reviewer validates change-control compliance
- @supervisor validates final compliance
```

[DELEGATION CONSTRAINTS]
- Maximum delegation depth: 3 levels (to avoid deep chains)
- Circular delegation forbidden (A → B → A)
- Delegation must be explicit in agent output
- Context must be passed to delegated agent
- Delegated agent must acknowledge context from delegating agent

- `docs/multi-agent/delegation-matrix.md` — Complete delegation capability matrix
- `docs/multi-agent/parallel-semantics.md` — Parallel execution semantics
- `docs/multi-agent/conditional-semantics.md` — Conditional workflow semantics

[WORKFLOW CHECKS]
- **MANDATORY:** Multi-agent workflows for backend changes MUST include appropriate spine rule checks:
  - **Architecture checks:** Ensure `@architect` validates against `.cursor/rules/36-architecture.mdc` and `.cursor/rules/44-ddd.mdc` (bounded contexts, layering, trust tiers, domain purity).
  - **Security checks:** For Tier H/M contexts or security-sensitive changes, ensure `@security-auditor` validates against `.cursor/rules/30-security.mdc` and `.cursor/rules/30-threat-modeling.mdc`.
  - **Change-discipline checks:** Ensure testing agents (`@test-engineer`) and review agents (`@code-reviewer`, `@supervisor`) validate against:
    - `.cursor/rules/23-change-control.mdc` (change classification, ADR requirements)
    - `.cursor/rules/45-bugfix-protocol.mdc` (regression tests for bugfixes)
    - `.cursor/rules/46-regression-discipline.mdc` (tests as contracts)
    - `.cursor/rules/47-diff-discipline.mdc` (diff scope)
    - `.cursor/rules/48-doc-sync.mdc` (spec/doc updates)
  - **Config/flags/API lifecycle checks:** For changes affecting configuration, feature flags, or APIs, ensure validation against:
    - `.cursor/rules/3E-config-environments.mdc` (config sources, secrets, environment parity)
    - `.cursor/rules/3F-feature-flags-rollouts.mdc` (flag design, rollout/rollback strategies)
    - `.cursor/rules/35-api-lifecycle.mdc` (API versioning, backward compatibility, deprecation)
- **MANDATORY:** `@supervisor` MUST validate that all relevant spine rules are checked before marking a workflow as "approved" or "complete".

[CONFLICT RESOLUTION]
- Hierarchy:
  - Orchestration MUST respect the global rule hierarchy defined in `.cursor/rules/10-global.mdc`:
    - Architecture & DDD (36/44/38),
    - Security, Threat Modeling & AI Governance (30/30-threat-modeling/22),
    - Change Discipline & Contracts (23/45/46/47/48/35),
    - Data (3B), Config (3E), Flags (3F), Observability & Operations (32/3D), Language rules (50-lang-*.mdc).
  - Workflow convenience or user preference MUST NOT override these clusters unless a valid risk override is in effect per `.cursor/rules/3G-risk-overrides.mdc`.
- Disagreements between agents:
  - If agents disagree on whether a change is compliant:
    - `@supervisor` is the final arbiter within the orchestration flow and MUST apply the global invariants and risk-override rules before approving any path.
    - `@supervisor` MUST treat architecture, security, and change-discipline violations as blocking; other agents MUST NOT "outvote" or bypass `@supervisor` decisions.
  - If `@supervisor` marks an issue as blocking, the orchestrator and other agents MUST:
    - Either adjust the plan to a compliant alternative, or
    - Require the user to supply an explicit `RISK_OVERRIDE` block (as defined in `.cursor/rules/3G-risk-overrides.mdc`) before proceeding with a non-compliant path.
  - **MANDATORY:** If `@supervisor` deems a proposal non-compliant with core rules, the workflow MUST NOT proceed as "approved" unless a risk override is explicitly invoked per `.cursor/rules/3G-risk-overrides.mdc`. Other agents MUST NOT attempt to override `@supervisor`'s blocking decisions.
- User overrides:
  - User-provided risk overrides MAY relax specific rules for a limited time and scope, but:
    - Orchestration MUST still minimize blast radius (`.cursor/rules/47-diff-discipline.mdc`) and respect rollout/rollback and observability requirements (`.cursor/rules/3F-feature-flags-rollouts.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/32-observability.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/3D-operations.mdc`).
    - All agents participating in the workflow MUST be informed of the override and its lifetime, and MUST still surface safer alternatives when feasible.

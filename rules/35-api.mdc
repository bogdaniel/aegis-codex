[SOURCE OF TRUTH]
- Editable source: `rules/35-api.mdc`
- Generated/consumed copy: `.cursor/rules/35-api.mdc` (keep references intact)

[INTENT]
- Deprecated: direct readers to `rules/35-api-lifecycle.mdc` for canonical API rules; retain legacy note for compatibility.

[APPLICABILITY]
- Applies only as a legacy reference; use `rules/35-api-lifecycle.mdc` for current work. Deviations require explicit risk override per `.cursor/rules/3G-risk-overrides.mdc`.

[CROSS-REFERENCES]
- Architecture/DDD: `.cursor/rules/36-architecture.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/44-ddd.mdc` (binding)
- Testing/change-discipline: `.cursor/rules/31-testing.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/23-change-control.mdc` (binding)
- Risk overrides: `.cursor/rules/3G-risk-overrides.mdc` (explicit overrides only)

This file is kept only for backward compatibility and references; all constraints are preserved and extended in `rules/35-api-lifecycle.mdc`.

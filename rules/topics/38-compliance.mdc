[SOURCE OF TRUTH]
- Editable source: `rules/topics/38-compliance.mdc`
- Generated/consumed copy: `.cursor/rules/38-compliance.mdc` (keep references intact)

[INTENT]
- Define compliance checklist enforcement for regulated/sensitive contexts.

[APPLICABILITY]
- Applies to compliance-sensitive work and audits; requirements are binding unless an explicit risk override per `.cursor/rules/3G-risk-overrides.mdc` is provided.

[CROSS-REFERENCES]
- Architecture/DDD: `.cursor/rules/36-architecture.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/44-ddd.mdc` (binding)
- Testing/change-discipline: `.cursor/rules/31-testing.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/23-change-control.mdc` (binding)
- Risk overrides: `.cursor/rules/3G-risk-overrides.mdc` (explicit overrides only)

[COMPLIANCE BASELINE]
- Use `docs/compliance-checklist.md` as acceptance bar: security, testing, observability, performance, CI/CD, documentation all satisfied before "done."
- Ensure SBOM and vulnerability scans clean; secrets scan passes.
- Ensure rollback plan and feature flags exist for risky changes; ORR before global enablement.
- Require documentation updates (README/ADR/api docs) when behavior or contracts change.
- Verification artifact: cite checklist items covered and command(s) run (tests, scans, sbom).

[ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE — MANDATORY]
- Architecture compliance (36-architecture.mdc + 44-ddd.mdc + language rules) is part of the compliance checklist.
- If violated, feature is NOT "done".
- Compliance check MUST explicitly confirm:
  - Layering respected.
  - Bounded contexts not violated.
  - No raw external DTOs in domain.

[POLICY VALIDATION — MANDATORY]
- **MANDATORY:** Policy scenarios in `tests/policies/` MUST be validated when rules change.
- **MANDATORY:** If policy validation fails, tighten relevant `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files.
- Policy scenarios validate agent behavior against critical policies (security, testing, architecture).
- See `tests/policies/README.md` for policy scenario structure and validation criteria.
- See `tests/policies/ENFORCEMENT.md` for enforcement mechanisms.

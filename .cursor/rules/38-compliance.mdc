[COMPLIANCE BASELINE]
- Use `docs/compliance-checklist.md` as acceptance bar: security, testing, observability, performance, CI/CD, documentation all satisfied before "done."
- Ensure SBOM and vulnerability scans clean; secrets scan passes.
- Ensure rollback plan and feature flags exist for risky changes; ORR before global enablement.
- Require documentation updates (README/ADR/api docs) when behavior or contracts change.
- Verification artifact: cite checklist items covered and command(s) run (tests, scans, sbom).

[ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE — MANDATORY]
- Architecture compliance (36-architecture.mdc + 44-ddd.mdc + language rules) is part of the compliance checklist.
- If violated, feature is NOT "done".
- Compliance check MUST explicitly confirm:
  - Layering respected.
  - Bounded contexts not violated.
  - No raw external DTOs in domain.

[COMPLIANCE BASELINE]
- Use `docs/compliance-checklist.md` as acceptance bar: security, testing, observability, performance, CI/CD, documentation all satisfied before “done.”
- Ensure SBOM and vulnerability scans clean; secrets scan passes.
- Ensure rollback plan and feature flags exist for risky changes; ORR before global enablement.
- Require documentation updates (README/ADR/api docs) when behavior or contracts change.
- Verification artifact: cite checklist items covered and command(s) run (tests, scans, sbom).

[INTENT]
- Null Object is a behavioural pattern used to address a recurring design problem in a controlled, explicit way.

[WHEN_TO_USE]
- Use **Null Object** when it clearly simplifies the design compared to straightforward code, and when the problem it solves is present in this codebase.
- Consider it only if it improves clarity, testability, or flexibility versus a simpler alternative.
- Prefer language-idiomatic constructs (functions, modules, composition) where they achieve the same effect with less ceremony.

[WHEN_NOT_TO_USE]
- Do **not** force Null Object into code that is already simple and clear without it.
- Avoid it when it increases indirection without reducing real complexity, or when it primarily serves as resume-driven development.
- Treat it as a smell if it appears only because someone recognised the pattern name rather than a concrete problem.

[ACTIONS_FOR_AGENTS]
- `@architect`: If Null Object is appropriate, explain **which concrete problem** it solves here (e.g., variability of algorithms, integration boundary, domain consistency) and why it beats simpler alternatives.
- `@code-reviewer`: When you see Null Object, verify it is implemented cleanly, does not violate SOLID/design principles, and is justified by the problem. If not, recommend a simpler refactor.
- `@refactorer`: When refactoring, consider introducing Null Object only if it removes duplication, clarifies responsibilities, or isolates change hotspots; otherwise, favour straightforward composition.

[PERFORMANCE BASELINE]
- Measure first with realistic workloads; address hot paths/N+1s only; prefer simplicity over clever micro-optimizations.
- Complexity: choose appropriate data structures; avoid accidental O(n^2+); batch external calls.
- Application/API: enforce limits per request (page/batch size); paginate all lists (cursor preferred for large sets); avoid unbounded work.
- Data/storage: index common queries; reuse pooled connections; set timeouts; avoid long transactions; compress/stream large payloads.
- Concurrency: bounded concurrency with back-pressure; timeouts/retries with jitter and circuit breakers for remote calls; avoid unbounded goroutines/threads/promises.
- Caching: safe caching for idempotent reads; define TTL and invalidation; respect consistency.
- Resource management: close/cleanup handles; cap memory/FD/thread use; avoid per-request allocations in tight loops.

[VERIFICATION]
- Provide benchmark/load-test/check (e.g., `go test -bench .`, `npm run bench`, `wrk -t2 -c10 -d30s http://...`) and expected latency/throughput target.

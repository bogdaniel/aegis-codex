[CODE STRUCTURE BASELINE]
- Modular: cohesive modules; avoid grab-bag files; prefer feature/domain folders when it improves cohesion; keep layers clear inside features (domain/app/infra/presentation).
- Naming: clear, descriptive, domain-aligned; avoid abbreviations/generic names; expose public surfaces (index/public files) instead of deep imports; avoid circular deps.
- Principles: DRY/KISS/YAGNI; small focused functions (~20–30 lines); extract helpers for distinct steps/branches; isolate I/O from pure logic.
- Config: externalize env/config; no hardcoded env-specific constants; remove dead code/unused deps.

[VERIFICATION]
- Run formatter/linter for the language to ensure structure/naming/import hygiene.

# Foundational Principles (Short, Always-On)
- Separation of concerns; high cohesion, low coupling.
- Contracts first: types/schemas/APIs are the source of truth.
- Prefer composition > inheritance; small, reversible changes.
- Secure-by-default; validate at boundaries; least privilege.
- Deterministic tests; observable systems from day 0.
- No secrets in code/logs; resource disposal is mandatory.

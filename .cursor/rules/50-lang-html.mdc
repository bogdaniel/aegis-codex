[HTML STANDARDS]
- Structure: semantic tags (header/nav/main/section/article/footer); meaningful heading hierarchy; include `lang`, charset, and viewport meta; avoid div/span soup.
- Accessibility/security: label form controls; use aria where semantics insufficient; avoid inline event handlers; escape untrusted content; prefer CSP/HSTS/referrer policies at server; avoid inline scripts/styles unless hashed.
- Performance: optimize and lazy-load images/media; modern formats; defer/async scripts; minimize DOM depth; prefer CSS for layout/effects.
- Tooling: lint with `htmlhint`/`eslint-plugin-html`; prettify formatting.
- Verification artifact: `npx htmlhint "**/*.html"` (or configured linter) and `prettier --check "**/*.html"`.

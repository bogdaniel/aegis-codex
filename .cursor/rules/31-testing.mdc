[TESTING BASELINE]
- Coverage: target ≥80% critical code paths; prioritize domain logic, edges, regression tests for fixed bugs; fail on drops in critical modules.
- Determinism: tests must be hermetic, order-independent, and parallel-safe; no external network/clock randomness; control time/randomness/IO via fakes/mocks; avoid sleep-based waits.
- Structure: Arrange-Act-Assert; descriptive names by intent; avoid testing implementation details.
- Scope: unit pure logic with mocked deps; integration with seeded data and cleanup; minimal E2E on critical flows; use containers/fakes for infra.
- Isolation: small explicit fixtures; no global state; reset between tests; limit parallelism for shared resources.
- CI gating: block on flakiness; no silent skips; include coverage reports; run lint/type/security checks with tests.

[VERIFICATION]
- Provide exact commands to run tests per stack (e.g., `npm test -- --runInBand`, `pytest -q`, `go test ./...`, `cargo test`, `phpunit`) and include lint/type where relevant.

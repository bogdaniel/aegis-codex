[TESTING BASELINE]
- Coverage: target ≥80% critical code paths; prioritize domain logic, edges, regression tests for fixed bugs; fail on drops in critical modules.
- Determinism: tests must be hermetic, order-independent, and parallel-safe; no external network/clock randomness; control time/randomness/IO via fakes/mocks; avoid sleep-based waits.
- Structure: Arrange-Act-Assert; descriptive names by intent; avoid testing implementation details.
- Scope: unit pure logic with mocked deps; integration with seeded data and cleanup; minimal E2E on critical flows; use containers/fakes for infra.
- Isolation: small explicit fixtures; no global state; reset between tests; limit parallelism for shared resources.
- CI gating: block on flakiness; no silent skips; include coverage reports; run lint/type/security checks with tests.

[TEST FILE STRUCTURE]
- Test file import patterns:
  - Can import from any layer within their context (for testing purposes).
  - Can import Infrastructure adapters directly (for test doubles and mocks).
  - MUST use public API modules for cross-context imports (same as production code).
  - Test utilities should be in `tests/` or `__tests__/` directories.
- Mock patterns:
  - Mocks should implement ports (interfaces), not concrete classes.
  - Test doubles should be in test files or `tests/fixtures/` directories.
  - Prefer interface-based mocks over class-based mocks for better testability.

[VERIFICATION]
- Provide exact commands to run tests per stack (e.g., `npm test -- --runInBand`, `pytest -q`, `go test ./...`, `cargo test`, `phpunit`) and include lint/type where relevant.
